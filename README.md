- 👋 Hi, I’m @detectorisk, and much like metal detectorists looking for gold in open fields, I am interested in scrounging through the mud and the rain for insights through data. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data and storytelling.
- 🔋 On my github you will find a repository of all my analytical exerices, with a strong focus on ML and Deep Learning as well as mixed methods approaches
- 🌱 I’m still a student of the world of git, learning the art of clarity and poise. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work at the intersection of social sciences and tech. 
- 📫 You can reach me via my email kevin.kuriakose.official@gmail.com; or hit me up on my linkedIn profile "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-kuriakose-32031712a/"
